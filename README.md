## Usage

Create an account and start adding what you need to do in the future.
Each item can be a place in four categories:
- A place you want to TRAVEL to
- A PROJECT you want to execute
- Something you want to DO
- Something you want to BUY

You have controls for:
- How much effort the task will take
- Personal or professional tagging
- Important x Urgent matrix
- Cost tagging
- Possible start and end dates
- If the task should be tagged as NEXT
- If the task was COMPLETED

BONUS
- You can expose your Google agenda alongside the tasks
